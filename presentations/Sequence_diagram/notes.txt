In case of meal management, let a use-case be like this : "A meal manager plans a weekly meal-plan. For each day, the meal-plan will be divided in 4 parts - breakfast, lunch, afternoon-snack and dinner. The meal-plan will consist of data, for example, 10 residents want to eat chicken for dinner, 20 residents want to eat a type of fish, 5 residents are diabetic so they can't  eat rice at dinner rather they will eat bread and so on. So, the meal manager must buy 15 chickens, 10 fish, 10 kilogram of flour and other required ingredients".
